# Logic and Conditionals

In programming, we use logic to
get our programs to behave conditionally. Put
simply, we can use expressions that evaluate
to a true/false (or truthy/falsy) and have our
program do something based on the result. 

Conditionals are a critical part of complex
programs and we can use them to make our applications
seem pretty smart when they are really just running
basic checks like, "is this true? okay, do this. Not true? 
Then, don't do this"

In this section are lessons and labs on logic and
conditionals that touch on topics including:

* What conditionals are
* If..else statements
* How to alter the flow of a program with conditionals
* Case statements
